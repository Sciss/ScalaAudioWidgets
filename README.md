## ScalaAudioWidgets

### statement

### requirements / installation

ScalaAudioWidgets currently compiles against Scala 2.9.2 and requires Java 1.6. It builds with sbt 0.12.0.

To use the library in your project:

    "de.sciss" %% "scalaaudiowidgets" % "1.0.+"

To run the demo: `sbt test:run`

### creating an IntelliJ IDEA project

If you want to develop the library, you can set up an IntelliJ IDEA project, using the sbt-idea plugin yet. Have the following contents in `~/.sbt/plugins/build.sbt`:

    resolvers += "sbt-idea-repo" at "http://mpeltonen.github.com/maven/"

    addSbtPlugin("com.github.mpeltonen" % "sbt-idea" % "1.0.0")

Then to create the IDEA project, run `sbt gen-idea`.
